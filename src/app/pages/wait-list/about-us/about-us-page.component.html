            <p>Understanding patient experiences and outcomes is essential in the complex landscape of rare diseases.</p>
            <p>Patient Experience data is crucial for improving healthcare services, particularly in developing treatments for rare diseases (known as orphan medicines).</p>
            <p>Even though it is crucial, European healthcare organizations encounter difficulties in efficiently gathering, processing, and using Patient Experience Data (PED). These challenges include the absence of standardized approaches, a weak data collection culture among patient organizations, and the necessity for effective methods to begin data capture.</p>

            What does Patient Experience Data (PED) involve?

          </h1>
          <span class="text-left row margin-left-0 p-2">
            <p><strong>PED</strong> refers to the information and insights gathered from patients and their caregivers about their experiences with a disease or condition and its treatment. This data spans various categories, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Symptoms</strong>	experienced by patients and how these symptoms impact their daily lives.</li>
              <li><strong>Quality of life,</strong> considering the emotional, social, and physical effects of the disease.</li>
              <li><strong>Treatment preferences and outcomes,</strong> indicating what patients value regarding care, treatment options, and the consequences of these treatments on their lives.</li>
              <li><strong>Disease progression and management,</strong> describing how patients manage their conditions over time, including the effectiveness and side effects of treatments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PED aims to provide comprehensive insights into the patient's journey, emphasizing what is most significant to those affected by rare diseases, where individual experiences can be diverse and may not be fully understood.</p>
